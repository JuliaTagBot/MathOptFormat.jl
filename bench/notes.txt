Compressed MathOptFormat files are, on average, 25\% larger than compressed  MPS
files. This is due to a number of reasons. Two main reasons are:

 1) The ability of MPS to ignore bounds with 0.0 coefficients.

    MathOptFormat assumes that unless specified, all variables are free
    variables. Thus, a variable `x >= 0` requires a constraint:
    ```
    {
      "function": {"head": "SingleVariable", "variable": "x"},
      "set": {"head": "GreaterThan", "lower": 0.0}
    }
    ```
    In contrast, MPS assumes that all variables have a lower bound of 0.0. Thus,
    a variable `x >= 0` does not need any record in an MPS file.

    This is also true for constraint bounds.

 2) The verbosity of MathOptFormat files.

    To achieve generality, MathOptFormat files are verbose. For example, to
    specify a problem with the objective function `min 2x`, MathOptFormat
    requires
    ```
    {
      "variables": [{"name": "x"}],
      "objectives": [{
        "sense": "min",
        "function": {
          "head": "ScalarAffineFunction",
          "terms": [{"coefficient": 2.0, "variable": "x"}],
          "constant": 0.0
        }]
    }
    ```
    In contrast, the MPS version of the same problem is
    ```
    NAME example
    ROWS
     N   obj
    COLUMNS
         x         obj       2
    ENDATA
    ```

    However, much of the verbosity in MathOptFormat files is removed by
    compression.

Given these two factors, it is perhaps surprising that MathOptFormat files are
only 25\% larger.

The file with the smallest ratio of MathOptFomrat-to-MPS filesizes is `neos17`, where the MathOptFormat filesize is
only 36\% of the MPS filesize. In absolute terms, the MPS version is 75 kb
compressed (955 kb uncompressed), and the MathOptFormat version is 28 kb
compressed (1046 kb uncompressed). As expected, the MathOptFormat version is
larger in its uncompressed form. However, compared to the MPS file, the
MathOptFormat file is particularly amenable to compression. This may be because
the MPS file contains many elements with a zero coefficient.

At the other end of the spectrum, the file with the largest ratio of MathOptFomat-to-MPS filesizes is `tbfp-network`, where the MathOptFormat filesize is 260\% larger than the MPS filesize. In absolute terms, the MPS version is 874 kb (12,354 kb uncompressed), and the MathOptFormat version is 2,298 kb (24,681 kb uncompressed). This may be because the model contains a very sparse constraint matrix. Each variable (column) appears in three constraints and the objective.
